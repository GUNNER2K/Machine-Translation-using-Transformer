# Machine-Translation-using-Transformer

The objective of this repo is to implement a machine translation from English language ot french using a transformer. The Main thing is that the transformer used is implemented from the scratch. All the components of a transformer including Encoders , decoders , attention mechanisms , Embeddding , positional encoding and Layer normalization has been coded from scratch without importing any pre built libraries. 

### here is the architecture :

The file name of .py files correspond to the component mentioned in the diagram. 

The main File to test the forward pass of the transformer is transformer.py. 
python version 3.10.0 and above is recommended.
Make sure to run pip install -r requirements.txt to install necessary libraries.

The architecture diagram and the idea has been taken from this research paper : https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf
